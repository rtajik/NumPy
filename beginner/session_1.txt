# NumPy Tutorial - Session 1 (Beginner Level)

This repository contains the first session of my beginner-friendly NumPy tutorial series. In this session, I covered:

- The difference between a vector (1D array) and a matrix (2D array)
- Creating matrices and tensors using NumPy
- Using `.shape`, `.size`, and `.ndim`
- Array operations such as `concatenate`, `hstack`, and `vstack`
- A short introduction to broadcasting and slicing
- Working with `numpy.random` to generate random arrays
- Performing basic operations like `min` and `max`
- Normalizing a random 3x4 matrix

More sessions will be added soon as I continue building this learning series.
